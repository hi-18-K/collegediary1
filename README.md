# collegediary1

(college diary website for project submission in Skillenza Codeathon, a small version of collegediary with some less functionality, implemented in django.)



TechStack:- Django, HTML, CSS, Sqlite3(in developement environment), PostreSQL in Heroku Deployment
Storage :- None  :wink:


College Diary is project aimed to list all the projects done in college by students, academic files (such as notes of diffrent class, files of diffrent clubs)..
But the diffrence is that storage facilities for day-to-day purpose are provided by diffrent clouds (Google Drive, DropBox, AWS and many more) and saving the files
itself also decrease the performance of Application which needs to be worked much to be improved, thus I have created this app so as of save links to such files.
Also a short description can be added but not the complete notes and with that too, it will be helpful for everyone because anyone can share technical and notechnical resources of his/her field.
:innocent:


We have been trying to build this using Django REST Framework but that took too much time and deadline approached so early. Thus, We have created this with Django,
as We already have some working experience with that. 

This is just a minimal model of how things can be done and what can be done with this project. I have been planning to complete this by 26th September, 2020.. and upload
in the repo:- https://github.com/hi-18-K/collegediary
